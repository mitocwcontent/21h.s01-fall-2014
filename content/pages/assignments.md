Tips for Writing History Papers
-------------------------------

[Guidelines (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit21h_s01f14_tip_for_wri)

Weekly Responses
----------------

Each week you must choose a passage (roughly one sentence to a paragraph) in one or more of the readings assigned for that session, and write five sentences (no more, no less) in response to it. In your post, quote the passage you found particularly striking—vexing, novel, confusing, convincing, etc. Your five sentences should summarize your reaction, critique, or reasons for agreement with it; you might also pose questions or alternative arguments, interpretations, or offer counterevidence. These responses are mandatory but will not be evaluated with letter grades.
